"""Talk to Copilot by driving the GitHub Copilot CLI in non-interactive mode.

Useful when VS Code is not running. Two things make this workable rather than
fragile:

* ``--output-format json`` gives a JSONL event stream, so the answer is read out
  of a structured ``assistant.message`` event instead of being scraped from
  decorated terminal output.
* The agent's extras are switched off — built-in MCP servers, the ask-user tool
  and repository custom instructions — because this is a pure text-generation
  call and none of that should influence a job score.

It is slower and more quota-hungry than the VS Code bridge: the CLI ships a large
agent system prompt on every request, so even a short prompt costs tens of
thousands of input tokens. The bridge remains the default.
